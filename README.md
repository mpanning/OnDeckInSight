# OnDeckInSight
Processing software for "On-deck seismology: Lessons from InSight for future planetary seismology"

All raw data used in the paper is available for download either at the IRIS Data Management Center, or through the [Mars SEIS Data service MSDS](https://www.seis-insight.eu/en/science/science-summary).  This data is read using the [obspy python package](https://www.obspy.org).

The authoritative source for the archived InSight data, including all instruments is the Planetary Data System.  SEIS data is archived at the [Geosciences node](https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/insight/index.htm).  Wind data from the TWINS sensor is archived at the [Atmospheres node](https://atmos.nmsu.edu/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/INSIGHT/insight.html).

THe following python codes are included for producing figures in the paper:

`make_ppsd_panelA_fig.py` - Panel A of figure 2

`make_paper_ppsd_fig.py` - Panel B of figure 2

`windspeed_comp.py` - Figure 3 and panel C of figure 1 (Note that the summary RMS data produced by this script is saved in the file WS_SPviking_rms.csv)

`generate_atten_curve.py` - Generate interpolated attenutation curves using Instaseis databases previously published used in figures 5-7.  The Mars Instaseis databases can be found at [http://instaseis.ethz.ch/marssynthetics/](http://instaseis.ethz.ch/marssynthetics/) and are explained in Clinton et al. (2017) [doi: 10.1785/0220170094](http://doi.org/10.1785/0220170094).  The Europa Instaseis databases can be found at [http://instaseis.ethz.ch/icy_ocean_worlds/](http://instaseis.ethz.ch/icy_ocean_worlds/) and are explained in Staehler et al. (2018) [doi: 10.1002/2017JE005338](http://doi.org/10.1002/2017JE005338).  `planet` variable and `db_short` need to be set in the code to create files for all models used in the paper.

`plot_atten_curve.py` - Figure 5 (Note that this uses interpolated attenuation curves from the `atten_curves` subdirectory generated by `generate_atten_curve.py`)

`event_prob_matrix_ondeck.py` - Generates data files for figure 6 using attenuation curves already discussed

`plot_prob_ondeck.py` - Panels A and B of figure 6 (uses data from probability matrix csv files in this directory generated by `event_prob_matrix_ondeck.py`)

`event_prob_matrix_europa.py`, `event_prob_matrix_europa_lownoise.py`, and `event_prob_matrix_europa_selfnoise.py` - Generates the input files for figure 7

`plot_prob.py`, `plot_prob_selfnoise.py`, `plot_prob_lownoise.py` - plotting panels of figure 7

The specific data used in these codes including specific filenames can be downloaded at the archive preserved at [this archive](http://doi.org/FILLINDOI).  This data should be saved in a subdirectory called `datafiles` in order to use the python codes as written.
